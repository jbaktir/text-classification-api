                German airline Lufthansa has returned to profit in 2004 after posting huge losses in 2003.

                In a preliminary report, the airline announced net profits of 400m euros ($527.61m; Â£274.73m), compared with a loss of 984m euros in 2003. Operating profits were at 380m euros, ten times more than in 2003. Lufthansa was hit in 2003 by tough competition and a dip in demand following the Iraq war and the killer SARS virus. It was also hit by troubles at its US catering business. Last year, Lufthansa showed signs of recovery even as some European and US airlines were teetering on the brink of bankruptcy. The board of Lufthansa has recommended paying a 2004 dividend of 0.30 euros per share. In 2003, shareholders did not get a dividend. The company said that it will give all the details of its 2004 results on 23 March.

                SpaceX, the private space exploration company founded by Elon Musk, has successfully launched its Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida. The rocket carried a payload of communications satellites into orbit, marking another milestone in the company's efforts to revolutionize space travel and reduce its costs.

                The Falcon 9's first stage successfully landed on a drone ship in the Atlantic Ocean, demonstrating the rocket's reusability capabilities. This achievement is crucial for SpaceX's long-term goal of making space travel more affordable and accessible.

                The launch is part of SpaceX's ambitious plans to create a global satellite internet network, known as Starlink. Once completed, this network aims to provide high-speed internet access to remote and underserved areas around the world.
